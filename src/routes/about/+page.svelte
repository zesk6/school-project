	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>
		This app is a prototype of a potential sports reservation website. The goal of this website is to solve the current issues
		with the availability of sports facilities at WLSA. There are still multiple bugs and things might not work as intended.
		Anyone who has knowledge in web development can visit the Github to see the open-souced code and make edits if necessary. Created
		with <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Sveltekit</a> and <a href="http://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>.
